# This file is for the 0x18. C - Dynamic libraries

In this project, I learned about using dynamic libraries in C.

You will find the Function Prototypes in the main.h file

```libholberton.so```

A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life

holberton.h: Header file containing the prototypes of all functions included in libholberton.so.

```1-create_dynamic_lib.sh```

Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future

Bash script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files in the current directory.

```100-operations.so```

Let's call C functions from Python

C dynamic library containing basic C mathematical operation functions that can be called from Python.

Includes:
int add(int a, int b);
int sub(int a, int b);
int mul(int a, int b);
int div(int a, int b);
int mod(int a, int b);

```101-make_me_win.sh```

Code injection: Win the Giga Millions!

I bought a ticket for the Giga Millions and chose these numbers: 9, 8, 10, 24, 75 + 9. If you could run two commands on the same server where the Giga Millions program runs, could you make me win the Jackpot?
