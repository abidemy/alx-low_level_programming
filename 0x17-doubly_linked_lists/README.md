# This file is for the 0x17. C - Doubly linked lists project

In this project, I learned about using doubly-linked lists in C.

You will find the prototypes in the lists.h file

```0-print_dlistint.c```
Print list
Write a function that prints all the elements of a dlistint_t list.
```1-dlistint_len.c```
List length
Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint_t list.

```2-add_dnodeint.c```
Add node
Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list.

```3-add_dnodeint_end.c```
Add node at the end
Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list.

```4-free_dlistint.c```
Free list
Write a function that frees a dlistint_t list.
```5-get_dnodeint.c```
Get node at index
Write a function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list.

```6-sum_dlistint.c```
Sum list
Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list.
```7-insert_dnodeint.c, 2-add_dnodeint.c, 3-add_dnodeint_end.c```
Insert at index
Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.

```8-delete_dnodeint.c```
Delete at index
Write a function that deletes the node at index index of a dlistint_t linked list.

```100-password```
Crackme4
Find the password for crackme4

```102-result```
Palindromes
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


```103-keygen.c```
crackme5
Write a keygen for crackme5.
